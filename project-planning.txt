

Tools for project:

Github - Version control tool
Jenkins - CICD tool
Sonarqube - Quality gate tool (code scanning - SAST)
Nexus - artifact repo tool
Harbor - docker registry
Dev environment - deploy to dev server 
Qa enironment -  deploy to QA server 
Prod environment - deploy to prod server


How student can handle this projects by priority:

Create a cicd architecture diagram for the pipeline, follow these stages: Build --> Archive artifacts --> push artifacts --> quality gate --> docker build --> docker tag & push --> prod deploy

Needs:
	Write an ansible playbook that install docker and docker-compose
	Ansible playbook that creates service account on all servers

Setting up Jenkins:
	Create a centos server
	Install Jenkins on the server
	Create a jenkins admin account for managing jenkins server

Seting up sonarqube and nexus:
	Create a server for setting up these tools
	Add an extra 10GB ebs volume to the server
	Create a logical volume using the ebs volume and run your docker-compose inside the volume directory
	Run these two tools using a docker-compose file

Setting up Harbor:
	Create a server for harbor
	Run harbor on a docker-compose

Integration:
	Integrate all these tools to jenkins

Setting up prod server:
	Create a prod server
	Install necessary tools thinking we're deploying  docker image to this server

Set up pipeline:
	Create a cicd pipeline for your application development
	Pipeline must reference the stages you have on the architectural diagram
